# openlawnz-parser

There are 2 parts: Pipeline (getting data), and Parser (parsing the data).

## Parsers Quick Start for Openlaw NZ volunteers

1. Ask for a copy of the OpenLaw NZ DB in the Slack channel for your own PostgreSQL server setup
    * If you're interested in volunteering please get in touch!
2. Follow "General requirements", "env" and "Installing" steps below
3. Look at the [Database Setup](#database-setup) section
3. Look at the [Parser](#parser) section

## General requirements

- Yarn
- Rename `.env.sample` to .env.`env` (e.g. `.env.local`) and fill in with MySQL details.

## env

Where you see the `env` option in a command, it will look for the corresponding ".env.`env`" file in the root of the project. You could have `.env.local` and `.env.dev`, for example.

## Installing

```bash
yarn install
```

## Database Setup

There are 2 databases:

- `pipeline_cases`: this is populated by running the pipeline and is not affected by the parsers
- `cases`: this is populated and mutated by running the parsers

## Pipeline

### Requirements

*NOTE: The AWS pipeline is disabled at the moment.*
- If you're using AWS, you need to:
  - Put in s3 creds at `~/.aws`
  - AWS profile and bucket details in `.env`
- If you're using [apify](https://www.apify.com/), then fill those details in your `.env`
- Rename `pipeline/adapterconfig.sample.json` to `pipeline/adapterconfig.json` and fill in details
- You need AutoBatch. You can [download it here](https://www.evermap.com/AutoBatch.asp)

### Description

- Pipeline gets data from a `datasource` and loads it into MySQL into a separate immutable database.

A `case` datastore must return an array of:

```javascript
{
  pdf_provider: "<string>", // e.g. jdo
  pdf_db_key: "<string>", // (must be unique)
  pdf_url: "<string>" // location of pdf file,
  case_name: "<string>" // case name,
  case_date: "<string>" // case date,
  citations: "<array<string>>" // citations string array
}
```

A `legislation` datastore must return an array of:

```javascript
{
  title: "<string>",
  link: "<string>",
  year: "<string>"
  alerts: "<string>"
}
```

### Running

#### Flags

*datasource*:

  - `moj` (only works for `getCases.js`)
  - `pco` (only works for `getLegislation.js`)
  - `localfile` (requires `datalocation`)
  - `url` (requires `datalocation`)

*datalocation*:

  - a local json file OR
  - a url

*copyto*:

- S3 (disabled at the moment)
- local folder path

The folder the PDFs that have been processed are copied to.

*trylocaldatalocation*:

Try and look for data in this folder first before fetching it.

  - local file path

#### Get Cases

```bash
cd pipeline
node getCases.js --env=<env> --datasource=<datasource> --copyto=<copyto> [--datalocation=<datalocation>] [--trylocaldatalocation=<trylocaldatalocation>]
```

#### Get Legislation

```bash
cd pipeline
node getLegislation.js --env=<env> --datasource=<datasource> [--datalocation=<datalocation>]
```

## Parser

- Each time a full run of the parsers is started the `cases` database is emptied and filled with the `pipeline_cases` data before running through each parser
- Each script can be run individually

### Running example

```bash
cd parser
node parseCaseToCase.js --env=<env>
```
